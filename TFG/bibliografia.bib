 abstract = {This paper informs a statistical readership about Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), points out some of the links with statistical methodology and encourages cross-disciplinary research in the directions most likely to bear fruit. The areas of statistical interest are briefly outlined, and a series of examples indicates the flavor of ANN models. We then treat various topics in more depth. In each case, we describe the neural network architectures and training rules and provide a statistical commentary. The topics treated in this way are perceptrons (from single-unit to multilayer versions), Hopfield-type recurrent networks (including probabilistic versions strongly related to statistical physics and Gibbs distributions) and associative memory networks trained by so-called unsuperviszd learning rules. Perceptrons are shown to have strong associations with discriminant analysis and regression, and unsupervized networks with cluster analysis. The paper concludes with some thoughts on the future of the interface between neural networks and statistics.},

This review paper provides a brief overview of some of the most significant deep learning schemes used in computer vision problems, that is, Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks, and Stacked Denoising Autoencoders. A brief account of their history, structure, advantages, and limitations is given, followed by a description of their applications in various computer vision tasks, such as object detection, face recognition, action and activity recognition, and human pose estimation. Finally, a brief overview is given of future directions in designing deep learning schemes for computer vision problems and the challenges involved therein.},
